# Legacy data analyzer [![Waffle.io - Columns and their card count](https://badge.waffle.io/aaradhanas/legacy-data-analyzer.svg?columns=all)](https://waffle.io/aaradhanas/legacy-data-analyzer)

If you have built an application in the era of relational databases, you would have stored data in a relational form. As NOSQL databases started taking speed, it would have been difficult to migrate since the data volume would have been huge.

If we do not keep track of our customers trends and reactions to our product, it is very likely that we will lose our customers. To analyze such trends when the data is relational and huge, the legacy data analysis tool comes to your rescue. Give us your relational database and the kind of analysis you want make, we will do the job for you.
